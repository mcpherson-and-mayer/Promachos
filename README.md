## Explanation of what the program is and does  

_Promachos: Automated Pet Deterrent_ 

Promachos Automated Pet Deterrent system is software designed to run on
a stationary turret, which is designed to fire a non-lethal projectile at a cat or dog 
if it enters a restricted area (e.g. countertop).  
This is accomplished using a neural network to classify images
from a video stream and determine if a pet is where it doesn't belong.  
This project is written in Rust and Python, and is dependent on 
Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and ImageZMQ).  
The project was designed using a web camera, Raspberry Pi, 
and a set of servos to fire projectiles.
