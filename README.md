Promachos: Automated Pet Deterrent 

Promachos Automated Pet Deterrent system is a stationary turret designed to fire a non-lethal projectile at a cat or dog if
it were to be in restricted areas (e.g. countertops). This is accomplished using a neural network to classify images
from a video stream and determine if a pet is where it doesn't belong. This project is written for use with a web camera, Raspberry Pi
and a set of servos to fire a projectiles. The running this project is written in Python and Rust which is dependent on Keras,
Tensorflow, OpenCV, and ImageZMQ
