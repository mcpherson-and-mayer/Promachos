# Run next script to prepare for tensorflow install:
# TWO OPTIONS:

# 1. Build tensorflow from source
# https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_rpi
# Install Docker:
#sudo sh 01opt-dockerscript.sh
# Then install tensorflow with container:
#sudo sh 02-tensorflowscript.sh

# 2. Install tensorflow with pip
# https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
# **THIS IS MY RECOMMENDED APPROACH
#sudo sh 01opt-pipscript.sh
